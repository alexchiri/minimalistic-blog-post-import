# minimalistic-blog-post-import

The purpose of this project is to import markdown files with a specific structure into a [minimalistic-blog](https://github.com/alexchiri/minimalistic-blog) mongodb database.
In my case, the markdown files were generated using my almost-identical fork of [ghost-to-md](https://github.com/alexchiri/ghost-to-md), which extracts markdown files from the JSON file you get when exporting a [ghost.org](https://ghost.org/) blog.
